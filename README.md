# Logic-Gates-to-Computer

NOTE: This project was based on the Nand2Tetris Course, and all HDL simulations were run on the Nand2Tetris.com virtual machines. 

The project builds from the most basic chips: Nand, Or, And, Not and goes through many layers of abstraction to arrive at a 16 bit computer which is resemblent of the computers we know and love today.

Each of the folders are arranged in a hierarchial manner starting with the most basic gates, moving to adders and ALU, registers and sequential logic, storage, and finally the CPU. This is the order followed in the Nand2Tetris Course. 

The schematic drawings were done by hand as it would have been very challenging to conceptualize the implementation of more complex components such as the storage units, and the CPU.
